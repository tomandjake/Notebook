# 从需求分析到软件设计  

## 需求的类型 
1. functional requirement:  required behavior in terms of required activities  
2. nonfunctional requirement: quality characteristic that the software must posses  
3. design constraint: design decision such as platform or interface components  
4. process constraint: restriction on the techniques or resources  

## 和需求相关的人员
client ~ pay for the software to be developed  
customer ~ buy the software  
user: use the system   
domain experts: familiar with the problem that the software must automate  
market researchers: determine future trends and potential customers  
lawyers or auditors: familiar with goverment, legal requirements  
software engineers or other technology experts  

## 获取需求的主要方法  
1. Interviewing stake holders
2. Reviewing available documentations  
3. Observing the current system (if one exists)
4. Apprenticing with users to learn about user's task in more details
5. Interviewing user or stakeholders in groups
6. Using domain specific strategies, such as Joint Application Design
7. Brainstorming with current and potential users

## 高质量的需求  
1. Making Requirements Testable     
2. Resolving Conflicts          
3. Characteristics of Requirements          

## 对需求建模  

## 需求分析的两类方法  
原型化方法 和 建模方法  
原型化 ~  整理用户接口，如界面布局  
建模 ~ 有关事件或活动同步约束问题 在逻辑上形成模型  

## 用例建模  

## 业务领域建模  

## 业务数据建模
